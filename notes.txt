 @fry71: You can find the rack rails in the unpacked RE2DRender directory / bundle under PostProcessHD/ReasonBitmaps/RackGenRackstripXX.png

They are just trivially applied by tiling a couple of them vertically, as you can see in the GraphicsMagick conjure script RackRails.msl that is used to apply them.

Here is the fold button: https://www.dropbox.com/t/hsLMyS9lfzm0fNzS

It's placed at x=13, y=9 in lo-res equivalent, x=13*5, y=9*5 in RE2D / post-hi-res coords.
